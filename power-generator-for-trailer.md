# Power Generator for Trailer

Our company rented a container trailer with a portable generator in Savannah, Georgia where the massive mega factories are being built. Every morning, from Monday to Saturday, My boss and I come here at 7 AM and turn on the 100kW diesel generator. Usually, my work usually ends at 4 PM but my boss does not leave until 6 PM. As an Electrical Engineer, I was curious of how the generator and the trailer office's circuit breaker diagram worked.&#x20;
