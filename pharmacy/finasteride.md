# Finasteride

&#x20;    Finasteride, a synthetic 4-azasteroid compound, is a 5-alpha reductase inhibitor used to treat benign prostate hyperplasia by lowering dihydrotestosterone level. Inhibition of 5-alpha reductase enzyme lead to less peripheral conversion of testosterone to dihydrotestosterone (DHT), leading to less DHT concentration. Decreased DHT concentration in prostate or scalp can decrease benign prostate hyperplasia or hair loss. Finasteride is mainly metabolized by CYP3A4 enzyme in liver, by either attatching hydroxyl groups at the omega position of t-butyl side chain(M1) or further oxidizing to carboxylic acid form at the t-butyl side chain (M3). This hydroxylated finasteride (M1) and finasteride-omega-oic acid (M3) form only have 20% inhibition activity. Those M1 and M3 finasterides are glucuronidated by UDPglucuronosyltransferases (UGT1A4 and UGT1A3) and execreted. Because finasteride is extensively metabolized by CYP3A4, CYP3A4 inhibitory effect of St. John’s wort can decrease the plasma concentration of finasteride. Because finasteride alters the ratio of estrogen to androgen, it is biologically possible for finasteride to cause gynecomastia. Patients with advanced prostate cancer who were treated with a combination therapy of finasteride and flutamide frequently developed gynecomastia (30%) and mastodynia (10%) .\

2.
   1. Finasteride is extensively metabolized by the liver, mainly via the CYP3A4 enzyme pathway.
   2. Metabolites
   3. t-butyl side chain monohyroxylated: active
   4. The 2 metabolites (t-butyl side chain monohyroxylated and monocarboxylic acid) possess no more than 20% of the 5alpha-reductase inhibitory activity of finasteride
   5. Monocarboxylic acid: active&#x20;
   6. The 2 metabolites (t-butyl side chain monohyroxylated and monocarboxylic acid) possess no more than 20% of the 5alpha-reductase inhibitory activity of finasteride
   7. Clinical Management: Concomitant use of finasteride and St John's wort may require a finasteride dose adjustment in order to maintain the efficacy of benign prostatic hyperplasia treatment. The combination of finasteride and St John's wort has lead to lower plasma levels of finasteride\[63]. The risk of interactions cannot be excluded even for low-dose hyperforin St. John’s wort products, however the use of products that result in a dose of not more than 1 mg hyperforin per day may minimize the risk of interactions . Probable Mechanism: induction of CYP3A4 metabolism of finasteride

      1. Kidney - 39%
      2. Feces -  57%&#x20;
3. Identification of Finasteride Metabolites in Human Bile and Urine by High Performance Liquid Chromatography/Tandem Mass Spectrometry&#x20;

The expected increased prescription of this drug has made it important to more fully characterize its metabolism. Finasteride is a lipophilic drug (log Ko/w=3.2) that is well absorbed and completely, but slowly metabolized (Loftsson and Hreinsdottir, 2006, Steiner, 1996, Sudduth and Koronkowski, 1993). The phase I metabolism of finasteride has previously been investigated but only partly characterized. The metabolites found were two alcohols (M1 and 6α-hydroxy finasteride (M4)), an aldehyde (finasteride ω-al, (M2)) and a carboxylic acid (finasteride-ω-oic-acid, (M3)) (Fig. 1). Cytochrome P450 3A4 was later identified as the major enzyme involved in the sequential biotransformation of finasteride to M1, M2 and M3 (Huskey et al., 1995). In dogs, the oral bioavailability of finasteride was high (92%) and at least six metabolites (M1, M3, M4 and three dihydroxy-metabolites) were found in plasma, urine and feces. Finasteride and M1 were the major components in dog plasma (Carlin et al., 1997). When healthy human volunteers were orally administered \[14C]-finasteride, 39% of the dose was recovered in urine and 57% in feces (7 days sampling). A very low proportion (<1%) of the finasteride dose was excreted unchanged. M1 was the major identified metabolite in plasma (\~12% of total radioactivity) and M3 was the major metabolite in urine (18%) (Carlin et al., 1992). The metabolites excreted in feces were not structurally described, indicating the possible presence of unidentified metabolites in human bile.

3. Clinical Pharmacology: Finasteride Mechanism of Action\
   \
   While finasteride is metabolized by hepatic CYP3A4 isoenzymes, no drug interactions of clinical importance have been identified, likely due to the hormonal mechanisms of action and relatively large therapeutic window of effect. Finasteride does not appear to affect the CYP450-linked drug metabolizing enzyme system. Compounds that have been tested in man have included antipyrine, digoxin, propranolol, theophylline, and warfarin and no clinically meaningful interactions were found. Finasteride has not been associated with clinically important drug interactions during clinical trials, including a 4-year safety trial of 3,040 males aged 45 to 78 years. while finasteride markedly inhibited UGT1A4 activity in vitro in a drug transporter study; the data strongly suggested that finasteride is unlikely to cause clinically significant drug-drug interactions mediated via inhibition of the hepatic UGT enzymes involved in drug metabolism in vivo
